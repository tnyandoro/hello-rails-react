# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
messages = Message.create([
    {
      id: 1,
      greeting: 'Howzit buddy'
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      greeting: 'Titambire'
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      greeting: 'Share a smile today will be a great day'
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      greeting: 'Today is great day'
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      greeting: 'You are looking great to day friend'
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      greeting: 'Hey hows your day'
    }
